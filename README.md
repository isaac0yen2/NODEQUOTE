# NodeQuote

NodeQuote is a dynamic project that provides users with random quotes from a database. Upon visiting the page, users are presented with a randomly selected quote. If the database is empty, the application will render a message indicating that there are no quotes available.

In addition to viewing quotes, users also have the ability to add new quotes to the database. A button on the page redirects users to a form where they can input and submit new quotes. These quotes are then added to the database and become available for random selection.
